* BUGS

** DONE Haven't managed to bind Alt-left/right

   It's ^B/^F for now.  No visible error, the binding just never
   appears to trigger the callback (trace-checked).

   Explanation: the constant name is Gdk.KEY_Left, not
   Gdk.KEY_leftarrow.  And don't forget to recyce ghci between
   keybinding changes!
